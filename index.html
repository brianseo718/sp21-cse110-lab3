                    <br>Today was a pretty eventful day for me. It started off by me going to my comp sci two lectures 
                    in the morning. Afterwards, I made lunch and played some card games with my housemates to kill time. 
                    Then, I proceeded to do some homework for the day up until 6 pm. After that, I left the house to go hang out 
                    with some of my friends from college. My friend <strong>Kristy</strong> and I went to the restaurant Cross Street and then
                    we got boba at <em>Happy Lemon.</em> We went back to her apartment and my other friend Max came as well and we all
                    caught up because we haven't seen each other in a while.

                    Today was a very fun day because it was the first day of the weekend! IT started off by me going to my two
                    classes as per usual and I had to do my math homework for a couple hours. After I completed that and I 
                    worked on this lab for enough time, I went to my friends apartment for the night. I got to try his <i><b>Oculus Rift VR</b></i>
                     set for the first time and it was mindblowing. I was in a boxing arena fighting a CPU and then 5 minutes later
                    I was traveling through space and Mars. I really want to get a VR set after today because of the endless possibilities 
                    we will see from them in the next couple of years.

                    Saturday was a pretty <em>lazy</em> day for me. I woke up late from being out the day before. I woke up and some of my 
                    friends were already at my house with my housemates. We were all catching up and playing some sports in our
                    backyard. I had to do some <span style = "color:red">homework</span> in between though so I was doing homework from about 3-7pm. Afterwards, 
                    we decided to drink at our house and play some videogames in the house. It was really fun and I'm glad 
                    they all came over.
