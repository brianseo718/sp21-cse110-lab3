                    <br>Today was a pretty eventful day for me. It started off by me going to my comp sci two lectures 
                    in the morning. Afterwards, I made lunch and played some card games with my housemates to kill time. 
                    Then, I proceeded to do some homework for the day up until 6 pm. After that, I left the house to go hang out 
                    with some of my friends from college. My friend Kristy and I went to the restaurant Cross Street and then
                    we got boba at Happy Lemon. We went back to her apartment and my other friend Max came as well and we all
                    caught up because we haven't seen each other in a while.

                    Today was a very fun day because it was the first day of the weekend! IT started off by me going to my two
                    classes as per usual and I had to do my math homework for a couple hours. After I completed that and I 
                    worked on this lab for enough time, I went to my friends apartment for the night. I got to try his Oculus Rift 
                    VR set for the first time and it was mindblowing. I was in a boxing arena fighting a CPU and then 5 minutes later
                    I was traveling through space and Mars. I really want to get a VR set after today because of the endless possibilities 
                    we will see from them in the next couple of years.

                    Saturday was a pretty lazy day for me. I woke up late from being out the day before. I woke up and some of my 
                    friends were already at my house with my housemates. We were all catching up and playing some sports in our
                    backyard. I had to do some homework in between though so I was doing homework from about 3-7pm. Afterwards, 
                    we decided to drink at our house and play some videogames in the house. It was really fun and I'm glad 
                    they all came over.
